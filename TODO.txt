- cache 3-len paths in near cleaners (both cpu and CUDA)
- vec without range checks for better performance?
- avoid malloc/free on cuda (global arrays)
- cuMemHostAlloc (CU_MEMHOSTALLOC_WRITECOMBINED ?)
- devIsDistinctValues speed up?

- memory allocator for recognition? new/delete takes about 30% of time [low probability]
- Tinker with Csdp parallelism to be able to run it on Student. [v. low]
