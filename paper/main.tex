\section{Perfect Graphs}
All graphs in this paper are finite, undirected and have no loops or parallel edges. We denote the chromatic number of graph $G$ by $\chi(G)$ and the cardinality of the largest clique of $G$ by $\omega(G)$. \emph{Coloring} of a graph means assigning every node of a graph a color. A coloring is \emph{valid} iff every two nodes sharing an edge have different colors. An \emph{optimal} coloring (if exists) is a valid coloring using only $\omega(G)$ colors.

Given a graph $G = (V,E)$, sometimes by $V(G)$ and $E(G)$ we will denote a set of nodes and edges of $G$. Given a set $X \subseteq V$ by $G[X]$ we will denote a graph induced on $X$. A graph $G$ is \emph{perfect} iff for all $X \subseteq V(G)$ we have $\chi(G[X]) = \omega(G[X])$.

\paragraph{Editorial notes}
By solid lines we will mark edges, by dashed lines we will mark nonedges, when significant. Sometimes nonedges will not be marked in order not to clutter the image.
\todo{Where should we put it?}

\TODO{Give some examples why are these interesting, some subclasses, and problems that are solvable for perfect graphs, including recognition and coloring}

Given a graph $G$, its \emph{complement} $\overline{G}$ is a graph with the same vertex set and in which two distinct nodes $u, v$ are connected in $\overline{G}$ iff they are not connected in $G$. For example a clique in a graph becomes an independent set in its complement. A perfect graph theorem, first conjured by Berge in 1961 \cite{CB61} and then proven by \Lovasz in 1972 \cite{LL72} states that a graph is perfect iff its complement graph is also perfect. \todo{Should we give some proof of that here? Maybe based on proof in \cite{GC03}}

A \emph{hole} is an induced chordless cycle of length at least 4. An \emph{antihole} is an induced subgraph whose complement is a hole. A \emph{Berge} graph is a graph with no holes or antiholes of odd length.

In 1961 Berge conjured that a graph is perfect iff it is Berge in what has become known as a strong perfect graph conjecture. In 2001 Chudnovsky et al. have proven it and published the proof in an over 150 pages long paper \citetitle{MC06} \cite{MC06}. The following overview of the proof will be based on this paper and on an article withe the same name by Cornuéjols \cite{GC03}.

\subsection{Strong Perfect Graph Theorem}

Odd holes are not perfect, since their chromatic number is 3 and their largest cliques are of size 2. It is easy to see, that an odd antihole of size $n$ has a chromatic number of $\frac{n+1}{2}$ and largest cliques of size $\frac{n-1}{2}$. It is therefore clear, that if a graph is not Berge it is not perfect. To prove that every Berge graph is perfect is the proper part of the strong perfect graph theorem.

\TODO{How long and detailed overview of the proof should we provide?}

\subsubsection{Simple structures}

\paragraph{Pyramids}

A \emph{path} in $G$ is an induced subgraph that is connected, with at least one node, no cycle and no node of degree larger than 2 (sometimes called chordless path). The \emph{length} of a path or a cycle is the number of edges in it. \todo{Should we move these definitions elsewhere?} A \emph{triangle} in a graph is a set of three pairwise adjacent nodes.

\end{wrapfigure}

A \emph{pyramid} in G is an induced subgraph formed by the union of a triangle $\{b_1,b_2,b_3\}$, three paths $\{P_1, P_2, P_3\}$ and another node $a$, so that:
\begin{itemize}
	\item $\forall_{1\leq i \leq 3}$ $P_i$ is a path between $a$ and $b_i$
	\item $\forall_{1\leq i < j \leq 3}$ $a$ is the only node in both $P_i$ and $P_j$ and $b_ib_j$ is the only edge between $V(P_i)\setminus\{a\}$ and $V(P_j)\setminus\{a\}$.
	\item $a$ is adjacent to at most one of $\{b_1, b_2, b_3\}$.
\end{itemize}

It is easy to see that every graph containing a pyramid contains an odd hole -- at least two of the paths $P_1$, $P_2$, $P_3$ will have the same parity.

Five nodes $v_1, \ldots, v_5$ and a path $P$ is a \emph{jewel} iff:

\begin{itemize}
	\item $v_1, \ldots, v_5$ are distinct nodes.
	\item $v_1v_2, v_2v_3, v_3v_4, v_4v_5, v_5v_1$ are edges.
	\item $v_1v_3, v_2v_4, v_1,v_4$ are nonedges.
	\item $P$ is a path between $v_1$ and $v_4$, such that $v_2, v_3, v_5$ have no neighbors in its inside.
