\section{Perfect Graphs}
All graphs in this paper are finite, undirected and have no loops or parallel edges. We denote the chromatic number of graph $G$ by $\chi(G)$ and the cardinality of the largest clique of $G$ by $\omega(G)$. \emph{Coloring} of a graph means assigning every node of a graph a color. A coloring is \emph{valid} iff every two nodes sharing an edge have different colors. An \emph{optimal} coloring (if exists) is a valid coloring using only $\omega(G)$ colors.

Given a graph $G = (V,E)$, sometimes by $V(G)$ and $E(G)$ we will denote a set of nodes and edges of $G$. Given a set $X \subseteq V$ by $G[X]$ we will denote a graph induced on $X$. A graph $G$ is \emph{perfect} iff for all $X \subseteq V(G)$ we have $\chi(G[X]) = \omega(G[X])$.

\paragraph{Editorial notes}
\begin{itemize}
	\item By solid lines we will mark edges, by dashed lines we will mark nonedges, when significant. Sometimes nonedges will not be marked in order not to clutter the image.
	\todo{Where should we put it?}
	\item A node is $X$-complete in $G$ iff it is adjacent to all nodes in $X$.
	\item Given a path $P$, by $P^*$ we will denote its inside.
\end{itemize}

\TODO{Give some examples why are these interesting, some subclasses, and problems that are solvable for perfect graphs, including recognition and coloring}

Given a graph $G$, its \emph{complement} $\overline{G}$ is a graph with the same vertex set and in which two distinct nodes $u, v$ are connected in $\overline{G}$ iff they are not connected in $G$. For example a clique in a graph becomes an independent set in its complement. A perfect graph theorem, first conjured by Berge in 1961 \cite{CB61} and then proven by \Lovasz in 1972 \cite{LL72} states that a graph is perfect iff its complement graph is also perfect. \todo{Should we give some proof of that here? Maybe based on proof in \cite{GC03}}

A \emph{hole} is an induced chordless cycle of length at least 4. An \emph{antihole} is an induced subgraph whose complement is a hole. A \emph{Berge} graph is a graph with no holes or antiholes of odd length.

In 1961 Berge conjured that a graph is perfect iff it is Berge in what has become known as a strong perfect graph conjecture. In 2001 Chudnovsky et al. have proven it and published the proof in an over 150 pages long paper \citetitle{MC06} \cite{MC06}. The following overview of the proof will be based on this paper and on an article withe the same name by Cornuéjols \cite{GC03}.

\subsection{Strong Perfect Graph Theorem}

Odd holes are not perfect, since their chromatic number is 3 and their largest cliques are of size 2. It is easy to see, that an odd antihole of size $n$ has a chromatic number of $\frac{n+1}{2}$ and largest cliques of size $\frac{n-1}{2}$. It is therefore clear, that if a graph is not Berge it is not perfect. To prove that every Berge graph is perfect is the proper part of the strong perfect graph theorem.

\subsubsection{Simple structures}

\paragraph{Pyramids}

A \emph{path} in $G$ is an induced subgraph that is connected, with at least one node, no cycle and no node of degree larger than 2 (sometimes called chordless path). The \emph{length} of a path or a cycle is the number of edges in it. \todo{Should we move these definitions elsewhere?} A \emph{triangle} in a graph is a set of three pairwise adjacent nodes.

\end{wrapfigure}

A \emph{pyramid} in G is an induced subgraph formed by the union of a triangle $\{b_1,b_2,b_3\}$, three paths $\{P_1, P_2, P_3\}$ and another node $a$, so that:
\begin{itemize}
	\item $\forall_{1\leq i \leq 3}$ $P_i$ is a path between $a$ and $b_i$
	\item $\forall_{1\leq i < j \leq 3}$ $a$ is the only node in both $P_i$ and $P_j$ and $b_ib_j$ is the only edge between $V(P_i)\setminus\{a\}$ and $V(P_j)\setminus\{a\}$.
	\item $a$ is adjacent to at most one of $\{b_1, b_2, b_3\}$.
\end{itemize}

It is easy to see that every graph containing a pyramid contains an odd hole -- at least two of the paths $P_1$, $P_2$, $P_3$ will have the same parity.

\end{wrapfigure}


Five nodes $v_1, \ldots, v_5$ and a path $P$ is a \emph{jewel} iff:

\begin{itemize}
	\item $v_1, \ldots, v_5$ are distinct nodes.
	\item $v_1v_2, v_2v_3, v_3v_4, v_4v_5, v_5v_1$ are edges.
	\item $v_1v_3, v_2v_4, v_1,v_4$ are nonedges.
	\item $P$ is a path between $v_1$ and $v_4$, such that $v_2, v_3, v_5$ have no neighbors in its inside.
\end{itemize}

Most obvious way to find a jewel would be to enumerate all choices of $v_1, \ldots v_5$, check if a choice is correct and if it is try to find a path $P$ as required. This gives us a time of $O(|V|^7)$. We could speed it up to $O(|V|^6)$ with more careful algorithm, but since whole algorithms takes time $O(|V|^9)$ and our testing showed that time it takes to test for jewels is negligible we used this simple algorithm.

\paragraph{Configurations of type $\T_1$}

A configuration of type $\T_1$ is a hole of length 5. To find it we simply iterate all choices of paths of length of 4, and check if there exists a fifth node to complete the hole. See paragraph \ref{Optimizations} for more implementation details.

\paragraph{Configurations of type $\T_2$} A configuration of type $\T_2$ is a six $(v_1, v_2, v_3, v_4, P, X)$, such that:
\begin{itemize}
	\item $v_1v_2v_3v_4$ is a path in $G$.
	\item $X$ is an anticomponent of the set of all $\{v_1, v_2, v_4\}$-complete nodes.
	\item $P$ is a path in $G\setminus(X \cup \{v_2, v_3\})$ between $v_1$ and $v_4$ and no vertex in $P^*$ is $X$-complete or adjacent to $v_2$ or adjacent to $v_3$.
\end{itemize}

Checking if configuration of type $\T_2$ exists in our graph is straightforward: we enumerate all paths $v_1\ldots v_4$, calculate set of all $\{v_1, v_2, v_4\}$-complete nodes and its anticomponents. Then, for each anticomponent $X$ we check if required path $P$ exists.
